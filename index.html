<h1>All about me</h1>
	<div><p> Hi! My name is Joshua Benedict M. Odulio. I live at Makati City, graduated my Junior Highschool and Senior Highschool
	at Blessed Elena Academy. I am currently on BSIT-MI 202, my pre-chosen course. I chose this course because of my fascination to the technology and the advancements of it. In short I'm inlove with it. I'll do whatever it takes for me to finish my chosen course and I will not let anyone stand in my way of my future.
    </p></div>

  At first my mother told me to choose the course I am in right now. I was 17 y/os at that time. But I knew what I want when I'm just a young boy, and that is to become an Information Technology student. What inspired me to become one? Well, my uncle which is my mother' friend's husband showed quite alot of his skills in configuration and database manipulation on the machine. He even showed me a few details of the PC's components. But mostly at a very young age I never thought of that yet, come to think of it I only thought of how the machine made such an advancement that could simulate a shooting game, manipulation of characters, the graphics, and many more.
